## 🚀 What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository. Every time code is pushed, an automated process builds the project and runs tests to ensure that everything works as expected.

### ✅ Key Benefits of CI:
- **Early Bug Detection:** Catch issues early by testing code every time it's pushed.
- **Faster Development:** Developers get quick feedback, which speeds up the development cycle.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Automated checks ensure consistent quality.
- **Easier Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work together without integration conflicts.

### 🔄 How CI Works:
1. Developer pushes code to a repository (like GitHub).
2. A CI tool (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI) is triggered.
3. The tool automatically runs:
   - Build steps
   - Tests
   - Static code analysis (optional)
4. Results are reported back (pass/fail).

### ⚙️ Common CI Tools:
- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins
- Travis CI
- CircleCI
- GitLab CI
